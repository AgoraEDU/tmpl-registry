# Template Registry

This repository contains a registry of template identifiers used in the system. Each template is identified by a unique ID prefixed with `TMPL-` followed by a string of alphanumeric characters.

## Contents

The [REGISTRY.md](REGISTRY.md) file contains the complete list of registered template IDs. Each ID follows the format:

```
TMPL-XXXXXXXXXX
```

where `X` represents alphanumeric characters.

## Purpose

This registry serves as a central reference for all template identifiers in the system. The IDs listed in `REGISTRY.md` can be used to reference specific templates across the platform.
